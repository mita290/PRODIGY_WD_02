TASK: Develop a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS and JavaSscript. It has to display the time correctly and have features such as start/stop, reset and track lap periods. Building a stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed me to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and timer functionalities in JavaScript. I learned how to implement essential stopwatch features such as start, stop, reset, and lap time tracking, improving my skills in interactive web application development.
